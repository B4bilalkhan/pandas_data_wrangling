Start with a new Jupyter Notebook.\n","\n","2. Read the file `data/spending_ch5_practical_.csv` located in the data folder into a new pandas DataFrame called `spending_df`.\n","\n","  * Make sure you import the appropriate module first.\n","\n","  * Read the file `data/medication_class_ch5_practical.csv` located in the data folder into a new pandas DataFrame called `medication_to_class_p1`.\n","\n","3. Use the appropriate type of merging strategy (inner, outer, left or right) to identify medicines in `spending_df` for which we do not have a class, i.e., no entry in the `medication_to_class_p1` DataFrame. \n","\n","  * Hint 1, which merging strategy will create NaN for medicine that does not have an associated class entry? Count the number of NaN yields the number of medicines missing from  `medication_to_class_p1`.\n","  * Hint 2, which column names will you merge on. Use `head` to preview which columns you need to merge on. \n"," \n","\n","4. We have a second file called `data/medication_class_2_ch5_practical.csv` which contains additional medication classes \n"," \n","  * Read the file `data/medication_class_2_ch5_practical.csv` into a new DataFrame called `medication_to_class_p2` and concat both `medication_to_class_p1` and `medication_to_class_p2` into a dataframe called `medication_to_class_ALL`\n"," \n","  * Repeat question 1. using `medication_to_class_ALL`.
