This process is not always as straight forward as it sounds as there are some subtleties that we need to consider. The biggest issue is that two `Series` or `DataFrames` will often not have the same index or length, leading to the questions: how should we align the data sets?, and what do we do with indices that are in one data set but not in the other?

To help us out, `pandas`' has implemented a flexible `DataFrame` method called `merge()`, which, by default, operates  on `columns` with the same name across the `DataFrames` being merged, that is to say the intersection of the columns in both `DataFrames`. Furthermore, the default settings of `merge()` will only retain values shared between both `DataFrame`s. This is called an `inner` join strategy (see [default parameters in merge() method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html)).\n",

Though it could be omitted, we will include `how=\"inner\"` to keep our code clean and readable. Notice that we are going to have to set the `left_on` and `right_on` parameters since the columns holding the name of the medication being ordered and classified in their respective `DataFrames` are labeled differently; in `spending_df` the medication column is labeled 'medication', while in `med_class` it is labeled 'medication_name'.

    "Concatenating data consists of stacking it along an `axis`; this is also known as *binding* or *stacking*. Concatenation enables joining multiple `DataFrames` into a single larger one. Concatenating data sets is slightly different than merging, as it is done in `pandas`, since concatenation simply extends and aligns the `DataFrames` by either index or column and sticks the `DataFrames` together. Put another way, concatenation is either an outer or inner join with keys restricted to either the indices or columns.\n",

    "The image above demonstrates two different ways we can concatenate `DataFrames`: row and column based outer joins. Row based concatenation will stack rows and column based concatenation will stack columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenation is implemented by `pandas` in the `concat()` function; note that this is a `function`,  not a `DataFrame` object method. The `concat()` function takes one required argument which is a list of the `DataFrames` that are to be concatenated. The optional parameters include `axis` and `join`. By setting `axis=0`, `concat()` will stack rows,  while `axis=1` will tell `concat()` to stack columns. The `join` parameter can either be set to 'outer' (default) or 'inner', to perform an outer or inner join respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let us see how we would perform the row based concatenation illustrated in the image above. First we would build our `DataFrames`, `df1` and `df2`,  and then we would call the `pandas` `concat()` function passing it the argument `[df1, df2]` which indicates that we want to merge `df1` and `df2`. Although the default settings are correct for this task, we can set `axis=0` and `join='outer'` for clarity.\n",
