Furthermore, the default settings of `merge()` will only retain values shared between both `DataFrame`s.

Since we don't want to show lines that have missing values, we will stick with the `inner` merge strategy, which is the default for `pandas.DataFrame.merge()`. To do this we will call `merge()` with the `spending_df` `DataFrame` and pass it the `med_class` `DataFrame` and set the parameters `left_on=\"medication\"`, `right_on=\"medication_name\"`. Though it could be omitted, we will include `how=\"inner\"` to keep our code clean and readable. Notice that we are going to have to set the `left_on` and `right_on` parameters since the columns holding the name of the medication being ordered and classified in their respective `DataFrames` are labeled differently; in `spending_df` the medication column is labeled 'medication', while in `med_class` it is labeled 'medication_name'. This is a common situation and something you will need to be careful about when working with real world data sets.\n",

Concatenating data sets is slightly different than merging, as it is done in `pandas`, since concatenation simply extends and aligns the `DataFrames` by either index or column and sticks the `DataFrames` together. Put another way, concatenation is either an outer or inner join with keys restricted to either the indices or columns.\n",

The `concat()` function takes one required argument which is a list of the `DataFrames` that are to be concatenated. The optional parameters include `axis` and `join`. By setting `axis=0`, `concat()` will stack rows,  while `axis=1` will tell `concat()` to stack columns. The `join` parameter can either be set to 'outer' (default) or 'inner', to perform an outer or inner join respectively. \n",

First we would build our `DataFrames`, `df1` and `df2`,  and then we would call the `pandas` `concat()` function passing it the argument `[df1, df2]` which indicates that we want to merge `df1` and `df2`.
