    "You will see that there are functions and definitions that are a recurring need in your code. An example of this may be a function to find the average value of a list of integers. So, rather than repeatedly implementing the same function or redefining the same variable over and over again, you may want to stick to the software engineering principle of DRY, Don't Repeat Yourself, and thankfully `Python` supports this quite seamlessly. A `Python` file can be written one time and be home to those recurring definitions and functions. The file can then be imported at the beginning of a new project, saving time and effort, this type of file is called a `Python` ***Module***. \n",
    "\n",
    "These recurring functions and definitions are in fact so common that it would be impractical to put all of them into 1 file, so what we do is organize them into categories, for example, maybe we have one module for math and another for making plots. Furthermore, we may run into the issue where even those categories are to comprehensive and we only actually need a subset of the definitions and functions in the module. To solve this issue we can break up the module into smaller modules called submodules. But all these submodules should still live together somwhere since they are related, so what we do is organize them into a `Python` ***Package*** ( you may also see these refered to as a *library*). A `Python` package structures the way we can refer to the modules and submodules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily we don't always have to build our own modules and packages. There is a large community of `Python` programmers who have ran into many of the same problems and have created `Python` modules and organized them into packages that are open source and available for you to use for your own projects!
