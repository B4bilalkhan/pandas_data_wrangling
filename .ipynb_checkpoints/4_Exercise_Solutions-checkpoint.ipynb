    "# Exercise 4.0: Importing the Honolulu Flights Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "For some of the exercises in this chapter we will again be working with the data set contained in the 'honolulu_flights.csv' file. Please recall that this data set contains information about all the arriving and departing flights in and out of the Honolulu aiport, HNL, on the Island of Oahu during the month of December 2015. The data set contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column |Description|\n",
    "|:----------|-----------|\n",
    "| `YEAR` | The year of the flight  |\n",
    "| `MONTH` |  The month of the flight |\n",
    "| `DAY` |  The day of the flight |\n",
    "| `DAY_OF_WEEK` |  The day of the week of the flight |\n",
    "| `FLIGHT_NUMBER` |  The flight number of the flight |\n",
    "| `ORIGIN_AIRPORT` |  The origin airport of the flight  |\n",
    "| `DESTINATION_AIRPORT` |  The destination airport of the flight |\n",
    "| `DEPARTURE_DELAY` |  The departure delay of the flight  |\n",
    "| `DISTANCE` |  The distance of the flight in miles |\n",
    "| `AIR_TIME` |  The flight time without taxiing in minutes |\n",
    "| `ARRIVAL_DELAY` |  The arrival delay of the flight  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to build the `HNL_flights_df DataFrame` before trying the exercises in this chapter related to the Honolulu flights data set. To do this run the code in the following cell."
